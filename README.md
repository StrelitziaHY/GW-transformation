# GW-transformation

Wolfram codes to examine my method to calculate the GWs from high-speed sources. We only consider an one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a single frequency in its center-of-mass frame in this programme.

One should run GW.wlnb with  Wolframe Engine or Mathematica.

Codes inside "Wolfram codes" can be directly copied into a Wolframe compiler to run the programme.
